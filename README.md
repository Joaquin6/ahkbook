### Important note:
This project is processed with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll#readme). Check it out before contributing.
You can write your posts in HTML, Markdown (like this file) or Textile.

### Another important note:
AutoHotkey syntax highlighting via `{% highlighting ahk %}` currently doesn't work. I created an issue on Jekyll to address this. If anyone (a Ruby programmer) knows how to fix this, please do so and send the author a pull request.
