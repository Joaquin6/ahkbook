# Introduction
This project is intended to provide a collection of tutorials, scripts, technologies and a reference for AutoHotkey.
**It is not intended to replace the excellent AHK help file!**

## Contribute
Please help me with this project! Anyone who has a github account, fork it! Add your own posts!

You can use Markdown, Textile, HTML, ...
Learn more about [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll#readme).

When including code, make it work for all versions (if possible). Example:
{% highlight ahk %} ; AutoHotkey classic or IronAHK
DllCall("MyFunction", "uint", ptr) {% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ahk %} ; AutoHotkey_L or AutoHotkey v2
DllCall("MyFunction", "ptr", ptr) {% endhighlight %}
(doesn't work)

Anyone else who has (even minor) questions /suggestions / improvements, PM me at the (german or english) AHK forum or at github!
