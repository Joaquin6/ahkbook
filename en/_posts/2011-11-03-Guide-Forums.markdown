# A guide to the AutoHotkey forums

## Forums for different languages
There's the [english forum](http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/), the [german forum](http://de.autohotkey.com/forum/), the [chinese forum](http://ahk.5d6d.com/), the [korean forum](http://cafe.naver.com/AutoHotKey) and the [russian forum](http://forum.script-coding.com/viewforum.php?id=13). Of course you're welcome to post in any of these, given you can understand the answers ;-).
In this section, we will look at the english forum.

## Subforums
There are 7 public subforums:
* Ask for Help
* Scripts & Functions
* Bug Reports
* Wish List
* Announcements

* Utilities and Resources
* General Chat

Each of them has a short description what it is thought for. **Do not ignore this!** Posting in the wrong subforum doesn't make you popular.

### Solving a problem (Ask for Help)
If you have a problem with AutoHotkey, your code doesn't work or you don't even know how to code something, post in "Ask for Help". There are some prerequisities, listed [here](http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4986). Most important:
* try to solve your problem by **reading the docs first**
* **use the forum search or google** before you post, check if someone else has already solved your problem.
* **try some things out** before posting, and post what you have tried. That makes you seem more interested in solving your problem.
* of course, **don't be rude**, and check out any links you might get as answer
* my personal favorite: use a **descriptive post title**.

If you have a problem with a script posted in "Scripts & Functions", you may either post in the script's thread or in a new thread in "Ask for Help".

If you suspect a problem in your script to be a bug in AutoHotkey, it is often useful to post in "Ask for Help" first and let others confirm that. A moderator can move the thread then.

### Publishing code (Scripts & Functions)
If you have a script or a function etc. you want to share, post in "Scripts & Functions". Add a description of what your function does, the function (or a link), and if possible, an example script.

Also check out ["Hosting code"](#hosting_code).

### Reporting a bug in AutoHotkey (Bug Reports)
As mentioned above, it is often useful to let your "bug" be confirmed in "Ask for Help" before posting here. Also note that this is not intended for posting bugs in other scripts, post in the respective thread instead.

### Post ideas for future AutoHotkey versions (Wish List)
This is the subforum for posting your wishes *on AutoHotkey*, it is not intended for wishes about other scripts. Think about your wish twice before posting: does it make sense? Is it easy to implement? Is it worth to be implemented? Can it be done by a script? etc...

### Getting information on new versions and other events (Announcements)
This forum holds threads about announcements by AutoHotkey developers and moderators. You can't open a thread here, but comment on the existing threads. Today, most of the new threads are about new versions of AutoHotkey\_L.

### Sharing cool software (Utilities and Resources)
Here you can share cool software, websites etc. you have found, even if it is not directly related to AutoHotkey.

### Offtopic (General Chat)
In "General Chat", you can post about everything you want. You can discuss on what happens in other forums, the web and the rest of the world.

## Registering
You can post in the english forum without registration. There's no problem with that, but *please* choose ***any*** nickname and enter it in the field (and do not leave it empty). This makes discussion easier, as otherwise there are sometimes several users named <cite>Guest</cite> discussing with each other.

If you visit the forum often, or you plan to post in "Scripts & Functions", consider a registration. This makes you identifyable by other users (nobody else can post under your nickname) and offers you the possibility to edit posts later or communicate via PM.

## Terms of Use
When posting anywhere in the forums, please ensure you don't violate its [Terms of use]().

## Hosting code
There are pretty much ways to host your code. There's [autohotkey.net](http://www.autohotkey.net), a site which offers free FTP hosting (just create an account there) and a Pastebin, but only for AutoHotkey-related content.

More and more users also use [github](https://www.github.com), where you can host open source code for free (or closed-source for money), regardless of the coding language. Github is also used to [host this site](https://www.github.com/maul-esel/ahkbook/). Usage is a little more complicate, but you'll get used to it, and it has a lot of features.

Of course, you can also use any other hosting site, such as SkyDrive, Dropbox, or include the code directly in your forum posts. If doing so, please enclose the code in `[code] ; my code [/code]` tags. This also applies when posting in "Ask for Help".

## IRC
There's also an IRC channel for AutoHotkey available. Just check out [this post](http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=28311).
